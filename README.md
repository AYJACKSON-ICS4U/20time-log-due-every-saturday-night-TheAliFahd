My group has decided on learning how to use Java in order to produce a game.
Hopefully we will be able to turn it into an app once we are done.
In order to get started we will watch video tutorials, mainly off of YouTube, in order to get an idea of how to code in Java.
The purpose and audience of our game is yet to be decided.
Hopefully we will have an outline of our game by the end of next week.

We are thinking of doing either a shuffleboard game, an app that informs you about flights, or an app that allows you to share documents.
We want to create an app on which there's lots of room for expanision in the future.
We are trying to figure out now how much we need to learn in order to accomplish one of these.
Also, we have started looking at Java videos.
