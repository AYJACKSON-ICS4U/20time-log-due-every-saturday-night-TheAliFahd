ICS4U 20 Time project log

My group has decided on learning how to use Java in order to produce a game.
Hopefully we will be able to turn it into an app once we are done.
In order to get started we will watch video tutorials, mainly off of YouTube, in order to get an idea of how to code in Java.
The purpose and audience of our game is yet to be decided.
Hopefully we will have an outline of our game by the end of next week.

We are thinking of doing either a shuffleboard game, an app that informs you about flights, or an app that allows you to share documents.
We want to create an app on which there's lots of room for expanision in the future.
We are trying to figure out now how much we need to learn in order to accomplish one of these.
Also, we have started looking at Java videos.

I decided to switch my project to something else.
It would appear that I would be more successful in comepleting this.
I have just been registered on Rosetta Stone for an online Chinese learning program.
I hope to learn a basic amount of this language by the end of my 20 Time Project.
I've started off with the very basics, aka learning small words.

Continuing to learn basic Chinese.
I have added a pdf I use to refernce basic Chinese words and characters.
Ability to speak and read is still very poor.

#### 11/25/2017
Continuing to learn basic Chinese.
Program is focusing on pronouncing letters.
Ability to speak and read is still very poor.

Learning Chinese is proving to be very difficult with the time I have.
I plan to focus on just learning basic phrases.
Rosetta Stone program is a bit advance.

#### 12/16/2017
I've decided to change my project yet again. 
This time I'll be putting together a little booklet of basic chinese phrases that I believe would come in handy if someone were to visit China.
Added a webiste which I am using as a reference to start my booklet.
