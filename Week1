My group has decided on learning how to use Java in order to produce a game.
Hopefully we will be able to turn it into an app once we are done.
In order to get started we will watch video tutorials, mainly off of YouTube, in order to get an idea of how to code in Java.
The purpose and audience of our game is yet to be decided.
Hopefully we will havr an outline of our game by the end of next week.
